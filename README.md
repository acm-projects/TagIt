# TagIt

TagIt is a Chrome extension that helps users manage email overload by transforming inbox content into clear actions. It connects to users' email accounts (Gmail/Outlook) and calendars (Google Calendar) to automatically organize chaotic inboxes and prevent scheduling disasters. AI reads incoming emails, assigns urgency/category tags, generates one-line summaries, extracts deadlines and action items, then automatically detects meeting invitations and syncs them to the calendar while checking for conflicts.
